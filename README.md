# Python Sorting Algorithm Benchmarker

I've implemeted three sorting algorithms:

- Selection
- Bubble
- Sortation

Then created a benchmarking program that runs each alorithm 1,000,000 times and records the time it takes to complete.

To run the algorithm execute:

```
python3 benchmark.py
```

Example output:

```
The list to sort is [58, 61, 32, 97, 22, 9, 61, 2, 95, 50]
selection_sort completed 1000000 passes in 4.0 seconds.
bubble_sort completed 1000000 passes in 4.4 seconds.
insertion_sort completed 1000000 passes in 2.1 seconds.
```
